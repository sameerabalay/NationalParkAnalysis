# NationalParkAnalysis

Analyze National Parks Data. 

Sources of data:

WorkFlow:

Multiple reports are available for the national parks data for the last 20 years. The reports did not have location of the parks like State.

I decided to scrape the nps.gov website to get the parks by state since my initial investigation only gave a subset of park data (e.g., wikipedia)

After some analysis I figured I could get the parks in the state by this link but I have to loop through all the state codes to get all the parks by each state
https://www.nps.gov/state/ca/index.htm for California data

The html code of interest for extracting the actual park data is 
<code>
<div class="col-md-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-12 table-cell list_left">
<h2></h2># This field has the type. Possible values: National Monument,National Park,National Historic Site, National Recreation Area
<h3><a href="/alca/" id="anch_9">Alcatraz Island</a></h3> #  This has the name of the national site
<h4>San Francisco, CA</h4> # This field has City followed by , and then state code
<p>
Alcatraz Island offers a close-up look at the site of the first lighthouse and US built fort on the West Coast, the infamous federal penitentiary long off-limits to the public, and the history making 18 month occupation by Indians of All Tribes. Rich in history, there is also a natural side to the Rockâ€”gardens, tide pools, bird colonies, and bay views beyond compare.
</p> # this field has the description
</div>
  
 </code>
 
 h2 tag had the type of the national site. Eg: National Monument,National Park,National Historic Site, National Recreation Area
 h3 tag had the name of the national site
 h4 tag had the city and state code separated by ,
  p tag had the description of the park.
 
Since I was scarping the nps.gov for park name. As the data of interest here is name of the national site to get the geographical location I decided to store the information in this format in mongodb
 
 parkname:name of the park
 state:state where the park is located
 city:city of the park location
 type:type of park. Possible values:National Monument,National Park,National Historic Site, National Recreation Area
 description:description of the park

 I had to manually download the data in xslx format as the csv format was not user friendly. The download had to be done twice because I report was only available for 20 years but the data available was from 1979 to 2017.
 
 I had to do some data cleaning like renaming column names since the data I downloaded had multiple categories like:
 (Recreational Visits, Non Recreational Visits, ..) for all years so the strategy I used was to append the cateogory to the year so all the categories data can be read on one shot from a single xslx file
 
 The data was read from 2 xslx files and the data was merged and some columns like 'Average_1998_2017_Recreational_Visits', 'Average_1979_1997_Recreational_Visits' were dropped. 
 
 The data was not formatted correctly so I decided to go through some transformations and doing pivot table. I'm sure there is a easier way to do this.
 
 Given I was interested in the top national parks. I decided to take the following parks since they had the most visitors since 1979:
 1. Great Smoky Mountains NP
 2. Grand Canyon NP
 3. Zion NP
 4. Rocky Mountain NP
 5. Yosemite NP
 6. Yellowstone NP
 
 After initial analysis a line chart with the recreational visits of the top 6 parks for created and saved as src/recreational_visits.html
 
#### Reviewing the data I decided to do Chi-Squared Test

#### Null Hypothesis: People who like to do tent vs backcountry camping have no preference for a specific park/parks

#### Alternate Hypothesis: People who like tent vs backcountry camping have preference for a specific park/parks

#### Test Statistic
$\chi^2 = \sum_{\forall i,j} \frac{(Observed_{ij}-Expected_{ij})^2}{Expected_{ij}}$

#### For a level $\alpha$ test, reject Null Hypothesis if $\chi^2 > \chi^2_{(degrees of freedom, 1-\alpha)}$ and accept Null Hypothesis if $\chi^2 <= \chi^2_{(degrees of freedom, 1-\alpha)}$

##### Test Criteria
Do not use test if any expected values are less than 1 or if more than 1/5 of them are less than 5

##### Conclusions:

Parks - ('Zion','Grand Canyon','Yellow Stone', 'Yosemite','Rocky Mountain', 'Smoky Mountain')

Camping_categories - ('tent', 'backcountry')

###### The calculated $\chi^2 = 203937.53 $   

###### For 5 degrees of freedom and $\alpha$ = 0.05 (i.e., (1-$\alpha$) = 0.95 ) the  $\chi^2_{(degrees of freedom, 1-\alpha)}$ = 11.070
(Reference: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda3674.htm)


###### Since $\chi^2 > \chi^2_{(degrees of freedom, 1-\alpha)}$ we reject the null hypothesis - People who like to do tent vs backcountry camping have no preference for a specific park/parks
